I will be presenting at the New Media Caucus Showcase in New York City at 6:30pm on February 13, 2013. The event will be held at the National Academy Museum &amp; School in conjunction with the College Art Association.

The New Media Caucus is an international non-profit association formed to promote the development and understanding of new media art. The NMC represents artists, designers, practitioners, historians, theoreticians, educators, students, scholars, and researchers, as well as like-minded organizations with interests including, but not limited to, digital media, electronic media, mobile media, virtual media, and emergent media. Our purpose is to support and advance a diverse range of inquiry in order to catalyze further evolution of the field of new media art.
