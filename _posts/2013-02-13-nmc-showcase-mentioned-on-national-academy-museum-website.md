My work, <i>Orbs,</i> was shown on the National Academy Museum website in conjunction with the NMC showcase.
<h2><a href="http://www.nationalacademy.org/art-school/4th-annual-new-media-caucus/">4th Annual New Media Caucus.</a></h2>
The New Media Caucus Showcase presents an opportunity to sample the state of the art in new media from across the United States. Featuring fourteen artist presentations by members of the New Media Caucus (NMC) in rapid succession from 6:30 – 8 PM, the showcase celebrates the NMC’s first ten years as an organization and will be followed by a reception at the National Academy Museum &amp; School. This event coincides with the first evening of the Annual CAA Conference, held in New York City this year.

Presenting artists are: Margaret Dolinsky, Jill Fantauzzacoffin , Belinda Haikes,
Margot Herster, Dee Hibbert-Jones, Arthur Liou, James Morgan,
Ed Osborn, Derick Ostrenko, Linda Post, G. Alan Rhodes, Elia Vargas, Valentina Vella, and Doo-Sung Yoo. This is a fantastic way to learn about the artwork of a large number of artists in the NMC and a chance to meet and socialize.
