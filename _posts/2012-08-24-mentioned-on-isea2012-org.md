Frederick Ostrenko
Transmodal Journeys: Digital Adventures in the Physical World
at The Box Theater |Monday, September 24, 10:30 -10:55
Frederick Ostrenko is a new media artist and educator within Louisiana State University's AVATAR initiative. He will present on his interactive environments that focus on revealing hidden networks between people by creating structures for expression and discovery. His installations use brainwaves, text messages, live video processing, and electric shock as interfaces for people to explore their identity and connect with other participants. Frederick will also talk about a recent work, which is inspired by a hero’s journey towards transcendence, and how such a narrative relates to a participant’s experience within a digitally augmented environment.
