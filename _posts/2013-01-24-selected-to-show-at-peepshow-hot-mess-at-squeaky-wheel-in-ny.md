Change Industries will be shown at Peepshow 2012 at Squeaky Wheel in Buffalo, New York.

Buffalo winters might be a little chilly but there will be plenty of heat at Squeaky Wheel's HOT MESS-themed art-party, PEEPSHOW, to be held on Saturday February 23, 2013 at the DNIPRO Ukrainian Center (562 Genesee Street). Visitors will be razzle-dazzled with a dizzying array of art installations, videos, and performances filed under the category of hot, messy, and anything in between. Beautifully train-wrecked party animals, upside down palm trees and skewed cocktail parasols sticking out of plastic trash bags, melting ice caps, text messages you REALLY wish you could un-send, teen mom Farrah Abraham’s new album, that time Britney Spears shaved her head – all that is spectacularly disastrous and stunningly unfortunate is sure to abound.
