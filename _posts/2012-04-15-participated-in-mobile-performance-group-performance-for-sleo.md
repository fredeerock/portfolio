The Symposium on Laptop Ensembles &amp; Orchestras (SLEO) was created to address the critical needs of the burgeoning field of mobile ensembles. Our objective is to consider best practices in the field, create standards for classification and archiving, and to build a community of practitioners who want this unique medium to grow and thrive.

SLEO is not an organization, nor is it professional society. Rather, it is a venue for discussion and community building whose focus is on establishing laptop ensembles as viable performing ensembles at universities and in the public sphere.
