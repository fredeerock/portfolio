<strong>About the Program</strong>
The <a href="http://digitalart.lsu.edu/" target="_blank">MFA in Digital Art</a> is the newest graduate program at the LSU School of Art. Our<a href="http://design.lsu.edu/art/?page_id=705" target="_blank">faculty</a> draws from many backgrounds to support multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary digital media creation.

The Digital Art MFA program is comprehensive, experimental and flexible. Converging practices in interactivity, lens-based media and virtual spaces are central to our program, as are balancing individual explorations with team-based collaborations. We teach the expressive potential of hybridized technologies and democratized tools to engage with diverse audiences. We emphasize emergent forms and student work may manifest through integrated media including digital cinema, mobile networks, printed matter, performance, public intervention, audio composition, installation, game platforms and the internet, among limitless possibilities. Students in our program will be challenged to apply their talents to produce objects, experiences, and spaces that stretch their potential for cultural and artistic relevance.

The Digital Art faculty is devoted to fostering intellectually driven artists and communicators. Our curriculum facilitates discourse within the context of history, theory and contemporary society. Seated at the flagship research university in the state, our program encourages collaborations with faculty in areas from the sciences to the humanities, as well as cutting-edge industry creators. The School of Art has a strong partnership with the <a href="http://cct.lsu.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Computation &amp; Technology</a> which significantly augments the <a href="http://design.lsu.edu/art/?page_id=3833" target="_blank">facilities</a> and staff available to our graduate students.

Above all, we foster nimble artists ready to shape a future of art, cultural and technological progress.

<strong>Graduate Admissions</strong>
The Master of Fine Arts is a three-year program. The Digital Art area seeks highly motivated applicants from diverse backgrounds with a passion for experimentation, a collaborative spirit and a commitment to excellence in digital media pursuits. Students are required to complete 60 credit hours of coursework, a thesis paper, a public presentation, and an oral defense of their work.
