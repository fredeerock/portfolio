BATON ROUGE, LA (WAFB) -
A brand new program at LSU is already ranked among the top in the country.

The Animation Career Review recently ranked the university's animation program among the top 10 in the South.

When the university launched the program five years ago, only about five students were enrolled in the classes.

Now, 60 undergraduate students are learning the ins and outs of the world of animation.

"What's really nice about our program at LSU is they're not just learning how to sort of create animation, create games, but they're learning how to sort of push the envelope and go a little bit further and work with researchers as well as people from industry to see - not necessarily how things are right now - but where they're going in the future," said Derick Ostrenko with the LSU School of Art and Design.

Ostrenko, an associate professor, said the Louisiana's digital media tax credits have helped the program blossom.

On top of that, all of the new companies moving to the state bring people in the industry who can serve as adjunct professors.

The companies also give students internship and career opportunities in Louisiana.
